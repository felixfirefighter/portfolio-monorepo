description: Keeping your dependencies up to date.

next-forge comes with two built-in commands to help you keep your dependencies up to date.

## Upgrading dependencies

You can upgrade all the dependencies in all your `package.json` files and installs the new versions with the `bump-deps` command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm bump-deps
```

## Upgrading shadcn/ui components

You can upgrade all the shadcn/ui components in the [Design System](/design-system/components) package with the `bump-ui` command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm bump-ui
```

<Warning>
This will override all customization you've made to the components. To avoid this happening, we recommend proxying the components into a new folder, such as `@repo/design-system/components`.
</Warning>

<Warning>
The `shadcn` CLI will likely make some unwanted changes to your shared Tailwind config file and global CSS. Make sure you review changes before committing them.
